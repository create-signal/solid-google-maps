<MDXHeader title="Getting Started" description="Install and configure." />

The easiest way to get started is to start with any of the examples in our [./examples folder](https://github.com/create-solid/solid-google-maps/tree/main/examples). Each of the examples is a standalone application using a vite development server that you can copy as a starting point.

In order for this to work, an [API key for the Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) is required. For the examples, this key has to be provided via an environment variable VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, for example by putting your key into a file named .env in the directory:

<Steps>

### Set up Environment Variables

Add your Google Maps API key to the **`.env`** file in the root of your project. More details can be found in the [SolidStart documentation](https://docs.solidjs.com/configuration/environment-variables):

```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Install the Library

The library can be installed from npm:

```bash
npm install solid-google-maps
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import {Component} from 'solid-js';
import {APIProvider, Map} from 'solid-google-maps';

const API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;

const App: Component = () => (
    <APIProvider apiKey={API_KEY}>
        <Map
            style={{width: '100vw', height: '100vh'}}
            defaultCenter={{lat: 22.54992, lng: 0}}
            defaultZoom={3}
            gestureHandling={'greedy'}
            disableDefaultUI={true}
        />
    </APIProvider>
);

```

</Steps>
